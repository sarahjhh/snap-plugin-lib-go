## Snap Plugin Library for Go

This is a library for writing plugins in Go for the [Snap telemetry framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap). 

Snap has three different plugin types and for instructions on how to write a plugin check out the [collector](/examples/snap-plugin-collector-rand/README.md), [processor](examples/snap-plugin-processor-reverse/README.md), and [publisher](examples/snap-plugin-publisher-file/README.md) plugin docs.

Before writing a Snap plugin:

* See if one already exists in the [Plugin Catalog](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/PLUGIN_CATALOG.md) 
* See if someone mentioned it in the [plugin wishlist](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/PLUGIN_CATALOG.md#wishlist)

If you do decide to write a plugin check out the [plugin authoring docs](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/PLUGIN_AUTHORING.md#plugin-authoring) and let us know you are working on one! You can find us on [Slack #snap-developers channel](https://intelsdi-x.herokuapp.com/).
## Brief Overview of Snap Architecture

Snap is an open and modular telemetry framework designed to simplify the collection, processing and publishing of data through a single HTTP based API. Plugins provide the functionality of collection, processing and publishing and can be loaded/unloaded, upgraded and swapped without requiring a restart of the Snap daemon.

A Snap plugin is a program that responds to a set of well defined [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) services with parameters and return types specified as protocol buffer messages (see [plugin.proto](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/control/plugin/rpc/plugin.proto)). The Snap daemon handshakes with the plugin over stdout and then communicates over gRPC.
